//! The transcript state machine: a stream of [`AgentEvent`]s in, the reply's
//! evolving markdoc out.
//!
//! This is the part of "what an agent turn looks like in chat" that is NOT the
//! card formatting ([`crate::render`]) and NOT the transport: how narration and
//! tool activity interleave, which consecutive tool cards collapse into one
//! `{% mafold/run %}` group, and how a tool's RESULT finds its way back into
//! the card of the call that produced it.
//!
//! Two transports read it, and they read it differently — which is why the
//! state machine is shared and the reading is not:
//!
//!   * the self-hosted daemon pushes whole snapshots (`editDraft`, the Telegram
//!     draft model) because its harness streams every call first and every
//!     result after, out of order — a card must be able to change after it was
//!     painted. It reads [`Transcript::snapshot`].
//!   * a brain inside the api yields append-only deltas, because it executes
//!     its own tools synchronously and a group is already complete by the time
//!     it closes. It reads [`Transcript::take_committed`].
//!
//! Neither is a special case of the other, and neither gets its own renderer.
