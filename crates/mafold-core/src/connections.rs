//! Using a connection — the part that turns a stored credential into calls.
//!
//! Everything here runs **on a device that holds the master key**, and that is
//! the whole architecture in one sentence. The server relays ciphertext it
//! cannot open, so the only place a credential can be assembled is a machine
//! its owner enrolled. Consequently this module lives in the core rather than
//! in any one client: the cli, the daemon's MCP aggregator, and the browser
//! (through wasm) all need it, and a second implementation would drift on
//! exactly the details — token refresh, payload filtering — where drift means a
//! credential quietly stops working.
//!
//! There is deliberately **no path here that asks the server to make a call**.
//! When no device is online, a call fails and says so. Routing a request to
//! whichever device happens to be live, or letting the server hold a delegated
//! credential, are both coherent designs — but they are different promises, and
//! they belong behind an explicit per-connection decision rather than as a
//! silent fallback. See `.docs/connections-v1.md`.
