//! `mafold ask-hook` — Claude Code PreToolUse hook for AskUserQuestion.
//!
//! The native AskUserQuestion auto-declines in headless `claude -p` (no client to
//! collect the answer). We register this command as a PreToolUse hook matching
//! AskUserQuestion (see `harness::claude_code`); claude runs it BEFORE the tool.
//! It blocks until the user answers the `{% mafold/ask %}` chat card — the daemon writes
//! their pick to `$MAFOLD_ASK_FILE` — then returns a `deny` whose reason carries
//! the answer. claude feeds that reason back to the model as the tool's result,
//! so the model continues the SAME turn with the user's choice. (Validated: a
//! deny-reason `"The user answered: X"` is consumed by the model as the answer.)
