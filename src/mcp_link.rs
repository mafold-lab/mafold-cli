//! Linking an MCP server the USER named — the `mcp` row's link flows.
//!
//! Every other provider tells this cli what to collect through the registry:
//! a file to import, a variable to read, a fixed OAuth client to drive. A
//! server the user typed tells us nothing in advance, so **this module asks
//! the server** ([`probe`]) and lets its answers pick the flow:
//!
//! ```text
//!   RFC 9728 → 8414 → 7591    it has an authorization server that registers
//!                             clients: consent screen, PKCE, exchange — here
//!   initialize → 200          needs no credential: the address alone is sealed
//!   initialize → 401          wants a token: ask for one (terminal), or say
//!                             so (a link that began on another surface)
//! ```
//!
//! Discovery comes FIRST, before any `initialize`, because the discovery
//! documents are the one thing a browser can also fetch across origins
//! (measured 2026-09-04: 8 of 8 served CORS, against 10 of 12 for `/mcp`
//! itself — Stripe and Sentry serve the documents and not the endpoint). This
//! cli and the web pane therefore classify a server the same way, which is
//! what lets a link that began in a browser finish on this machine without
//! the two disagreeing about what the server is.
//!
//! The redirect for a dynamically registered client is an EPHEMERAL loopback
//! port (RFC 8252 §7.3): bound first, registered second, because the
//! registration request must name it. Each link registers a fresh client; a
//! link is a once-per-server act, and the alternative is a store of client
//! ids keyed by server that outlives the port they were registered with.
//!
//! What is sealed, and why the address is in there: `.docs/custom-mcp-v1.md`
//! §2–3. Nothing in this file writes cleartext anywhere but the label.
