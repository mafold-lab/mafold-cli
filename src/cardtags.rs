//! Bare card tags → the fully-qualified `owner/slug` the renderer requires.
//!
//! Card references became namespaced (`{% mafold/html %}`); a BARE `{% html %}`
//! resolves to nothing and renders as a grey "Unsupported card: html" box that
//! also EATS the card's body — the mini-UI or the ask options are simply gone.
//! The preamble tells the model the qualified form, but a system prompt is not
//! an enforcement mechanism:
//!
//!   * a conversation that started before the migration has dozens of its own
//!     `{% html %}` messages in context, and a model copies its own transcript
//!     over any instruction — those sessions emit the old syntax forever;
//!   * a model writes `{% mafold/html %}` and closes with `{% /html %}`, which
//!     is worse than a dead card: the container never closes and swallows the
//!     rest of the message;
//!   * other harnesses (codex/kimi/opencode) and `/`-commands reach the same
//!     send path with prose that never saw the preamble at all.
//!
//! So the daemon canonicalises what the model wrote before it becomes a
//! message. We already fetch the authoritative card list to BUILD the preamble
//! (`agent::available_card_tags`), so the same list can validate the output:
//! a bare tag whose slug is a published card gets its owner spliced in, and
//! everything else is left byte-for-byte alone.
//!
//! Two deliberate limits:
//!   * only KNOWN slugs are touched — `{% partial file="x" %}` and any other
//!     non-card Markdoc stays literal, exactly as the client renders it;
//!   * tags inside markdown code (a fence or a backtick span) are skipped,
//!     mirroring `cards/split.ts`: writing `{% html %}` in backticks is how you
//!     TALK about a card, and this repo's own dev chat does it constantly.
//!     Rewriting those would corrupt the text instead of fixing a card.
