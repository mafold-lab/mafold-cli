//! Harness abstraction — the pluggable coding-agent backend a daemon drives.
//!
//! Implemented harnesses: **Claude Code**, **Codex**, and **Kimi Code**; planned:
//! `opencode`, `openclaw`. Each harness knows how to invoke its CLI headlessly and
//! normalize that CLI's output into [`AgentEvent`]s. The renderer (`crate::render`) turns
//! those events into chat text + cards, so card rendering is identical across
//! harnesses — a new harness only has to emit the common event stream.
//!
//! A `Daemon` (one bot presence) is `(token + workdir + harness + model)`; the
//! supervisor runs many daemons, one process per bot.
