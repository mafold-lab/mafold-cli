//! Codex harness — drives OpenAI's local `codex` CLI headlessly
//! (`codex exec --json`) and normalizes its thread/item JSONL event stream into
//! [`AgentEvent`]s. The renderer (`crate::render`) turns those into the same chat
//! text + cards it produces for every other harness, so card rendering is
//! identical — this file only has to speak Codex's dialect.
//!
//! Differences from Claude Code that shape this impl:
//! - **No `--append-system-prompt`.** Codex has no system-prompt flag, so the
//!   daemon's mafold preamble (identity / conversation / embeddable cards) is
//!   folded into the front of the prompt instead.
//! - **Block-level streaming, not token-level.** Codex `--json` emits complete
//!   `item.completed` events (a whole assistant message, a whole reasoning block)
//!   rather than per-token deltas. The transcript is still interleaved in arrival
//!   order (§8) — narration, tool cards, results — just at item granularity.
//! - **Reasoning effort IS its thinking.** Codex has no separate extended-thinking
//!   budget, so the chat's `/think` budget is ignored here; depth is controlled by
//!   the owner-set effort (mapped to `model_reasoning_effort`).
//! - **Auth lives on the host.** Codex uses its own login (`codex login`, or a
//!   `CODEX_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the environment); we don't strip it.
//! - **Generated images never appear on the stream.** See [`ImageSweep`] — the
//!   only harness dialect we have to read off the filesystem instead.
