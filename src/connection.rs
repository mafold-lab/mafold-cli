//! `mafold connection` — your credentials at third parties, carried between

//! Link a provider once and every daemon you run can use it. The plaintext is

//! label, and a blob. See `.docs/connections-v1.md`; the ciphers are in
//! `vault.rs`.
//!
//! The command surface follows the trust story rather than the CRUD:
//!
//!   list / add / show / rm      the credentials
//!   devices / approve / revoke  who is allowed to open them
//!   unlock / recovery           getting a key onto a machine

//! Auth is the HUMAN session (`mafold login`), never a bot token — a daemon
//! running on your laptop must not be able to enumerate your credentials just
//! because it shares the filesystem.

// instead of importing a file: PKCE, a localhost listener on the vendor's
// registered redirect, and a form-encoded code exchange. The whole dance runs
// on this machine — the registered redirect URI makes any server-side variant
// impossible, which is not a limitation but the property that keeps the vault
// honest: the token is born on a device the user controls and sealed there.
//
// A fresh grant also races NOTHING: `--import` shares a refresh token with the
// vendor's own CLI, and two holders spending one rotating token is the classic
// way an imported credential goes stale under it.
