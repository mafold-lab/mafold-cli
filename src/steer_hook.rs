//! `mafold steer-hook` — Claude Code PostToolUse hook that delivers what the
//! user said WHILE the turn was running.
//!
//! The daemon's turns are long. A user who spots the agent going the wrong way
//! has, until now, had two options: `/stop` (kill it, lose the work) or send
//! another message (which starts a SECOND turn racing the first in the same
//! workdir). Neither is what anyone means by "no, the other file".
//!
//! So a mid-turn message becomes a CORRECTION to the turn in flight. The daemon
//! appends it to `$MAFOLD_STEER_FILE`; this hook runs after every tool call and,
//! when there is something waiting, hands it to the model as `additionalContext`
//! — which claude feeds in as part of that tool's result. The effect:
//!
//!   * the reasoning and partial text already on screen stay exactly as they are
//!     (nothing is killed, nothing is re-said),
//!   * tool calls that already finished stay in the turn with their results,
//!   * the tool that was RUNNING when they spoke finishes normally — this is a
//!     PostToolUse hook, so it cannot interrupt one,
//!   * and the correction takes effect at the next tool-result boundary.
//!
//! **Consuming is a race and is settled by rename.** The daemon also drains this
//! file when the turn ends (a correction that arrives after the model's last
//! tool call would otherwise be silently lost, and it must become the next turn
//! instead). `fs::rename` to a unique name is atomic on every platform we ship,
//! so exactly one of the two readers gets any given message.
//!
//! Empty is the overwhelmingly common case, and it costs one failed rename.
