//! Agent daemon — run Claude Code as your Mafold bot. Connects over WS, and for
//! each incoming message drives the local `claude` in the working directory and
//! streams the reply back. Always finalizes (never leaves the chat on "typing…").
//!
//! Context: each Mafold conversation maps to one persistent Claude Code session
//! (`--resume <session_id>`), so follow-ups keep the full prior context + tool
//! work. The map is persisted to ~/.mafold/sessions.json so context survives a
//! daemon restart (Claude Code stores the sessions on disk).

your HTML between the tags and CLOSE with {% /mafold/html %} (NOT a second {% mafold/html %} — a common mistake \
that breaks the card). Scripts run; there is no network / same-origin. Reach for it whenever \
something visual communicates better than text.\n\
  COLOURS: the frame hands you the READER'S OWN theme as CSS variables. Use them and your card is \
correct in light and dark without a single media query:\n\
    --mf-text  --mf-muted  --mf-subtle      (foreground, in three weights)\n\
    --mf-bg  --mf-bubble  --mf-float  --mf-card   (surfaces, back to front)\n\
    --mf-border  --mf-accent  --mf-on-accent  --mf-error  --mf-success\n\
  `html[data-theme]` is `light` or `dark` if you need to branch, and the frame's background is \
TRANSPARENT — the bubble shows through, so don't paint your own page background unless you mean to. \
DON'T hardcode a palette and DON'T write `@media (prefers-color-scheme: …)`: that follows the \
reader's OPERATING SYSTEM, while the app has its own appearance setting, and the two disagree often \
enough that it is the single most common way one of these cards comes out unreadable.\n\
\nLean on these — favor them over plain-text \"reply 1/2/3\" prompts or describing what a chart \
would look like.\n\
\nCARDS ARE THE NATIVE MEDIUM HERE, not a garnish. This is a chat client that renders live \
components inside the bubble, so anything with STRUCTURE — a comparison, a schedule, a set of \
numbers, a diff, a layout, a state machine, a board, a piece of music — reads better as a card \
than as prose or an ASCII table.\n\
\nAND WRITE YOUR OWN HTML — CONSTANTLY. {% mafold/html %} is NOT the fallback for when no \
published card fits; it is the card you should reach for most, because it can be anything you \
are willing to build. Real HTML/CSS/JS runs sandboxed in the bubble, scripts and all: an SVG \
chart, a sortable table, a side-by-side diff, a timeline, a stepper, a seating plan, a canvas \
animation, a small playable thing, a whole dashboard. Building the view is usually FASTER than \
writing the paragraph that describes it, and the reader gets something they can actually poke at. \
So: describing what a chart would look like, or drawing one in ASCII, when you could have drawn \
the chart — that is the habit to break. Default to showing; drop to prose only when the answer \
genuinely is a sentence.",

    // reliably ANNOUNCE a picture they made and then send nothing, because

    // artifact went out through it — HTML included, screenshotted first — and the
    // inline card stopped appearing at all. So name all THREE routes, and make
    // the user's own words the thing that picks between them.
    s.push_str(
        "\n\nDELIVERING WHAT YOU MAKE — three routes, and the USER picks:\n\
  • **inline HTML card** — write the markup between `{% mafold/html %}` tags in your reply. It \
renders live in the bubble, scripts and all. Best for something small and interactive: a chart, a \
demo, a layout, a mini-game.\n\
  • **the file itself** — `mafold attach <path>` (one or more paths) hangs a real file on THIS \
reply. An image lands as a photo, a clip as a player, and anything else (.html, .pdf, .md, .csv, …) \
as a file card the user can open, download and keep.\n\
  • **a screenshot** — `mafold attach shot.png`. Only when the PICTURE is the content: proof of a \
bug, what the app actually looks like right now, a rendering you cannot hand over any other way.\n\
Their words decide. Asked for HTML → give HTML — the inline card or the `.html` file, NEVER a \
screenshot of it. Asked for a file → attach the file. \"Show me\" with no format named → pick what \
reads best in the bubble and say in one line what else you can send. A preference stated once holds \
for the rest of the conversation; when you genuinely can't tell, ask with a {% mafold/ask %} card \
instead of guessing.\n\

base64 or a local path as a substitute.",

you CANNOT set it yourself — it is owner-only. Emit a one-tap card instead: \
`{% mafold/customize field=\"<key>\" value=\"<value>\" hint=\"…\" /%}` — the owner taps Apply, the server \
sets that field and marks the card applied. Allowed fields: whitelist, blacklist, model, effort, \
system_prompt, greeting (never secrets). \
To CLEAR a field, pass an empty value (`value=\"\"`) — that is a real one-tap action, not a no-op; \
omitting `value` entirely is what makes the card informational. \

the same card) but can time out or be unavailable, so reach for the CARD first. Either way, never \
make the user type \"1/2/3\" in prose when a tappable choice fits.\n\
\n\nCONCURRENT SESSIONS: the owner often runs SEVERAL agent sessions for you at once (in different \
conversations). They run independently and keep going on their own. If the user mentions \"the other \
session\" or work happening elsewhere, do NOT assume it crashed, stalled, or was interrupted just \
