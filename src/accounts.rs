//! Claude accounts on this machine — several logins behind ONE `~/.claude`.
//!
//! Claude Code keys its OAuth credential by a single directory: with
//! `CLAUDE_SECURESTORAGE_CONFIG_DIR=<dir>` in a process's environment it reads
//! and writes the login that belongs to `<dir>` — a macOS Keychain item named
//! `Claude Code-credentials-<sha256(dir)[..8]>`, `<dir>/.credentials.json`
//! elsewhere — and touches nothing else. Skills, settings, plugins,
//! `~/.claude.json`, the session transcripts under `~/.claude/projects/` and
//! the auto-memory that lives beside them all stay `~/.claude`'s. That is
//! exactly the split a bot wants: N subscriptions behind one identity, one
//! memory, one set of resumable sessions. (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is the OTHER
//! switch, and the wrong one — it isolates all of that too, so a bot would
//! forget everything the moment it changed accounts.)
//!
//! One account = one directory under `~/.mafold/claude-accounts/<name>/`;
//! `default` is the login `~/.claude` already holds and carries no env at all.
//! The registry (`~/.mafold/claude-accounts.json`) is machine-level: a usage
//! limit belongs to the account, not to the daemon that ran into it, so every
//! daemon on the box reads the same file and writes it atomically (rename;
//! last writer wins — the most a lost write costs is one extra attempt on a
//! window somebody else already found full).
//!
//! Selection is sticky, not round-robin: a turn runs on the account it was
//! asked for (`/account` › the Customize sheet › `default`) until that seat's
//! window is full, then on the first other seat that is not, and it comes back
//! by itself once the window rolls over. Windows are remembered by their reset
//! time (`exhausted`), which is what makes "come back by itself" free.
