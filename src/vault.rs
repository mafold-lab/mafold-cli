//! Where THIS machine keeps its vault key material.
//!
//! The crypto itself is not here — it moved to `mafold_core::vault` so the cli
//! and the web run the same key hierarchy. Two implementations would eventually
//! disagree on a nonce or a KDF label, and the symptom would be a credential
//! added on one device that refuses to open on another: a data bug that only
//! appears after the user has already trusted the second device.
//!
//! What IS here is the part that genuinely differs per platform: a Unix file at
//! 0600 versus the browser's IndexedDB. Pretending one abstraction covered both
//! would mean the weaker guarantee silently setting the terms for the stronger.
