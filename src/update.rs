//! Self-update — fetch the latest GitHub release and replace the binary safely.
//!
//! Safety (matters now that one machine runs many daemons sharing one binary):
//! - a cross-process **flock** (`~/.mafold/update.lock`) so only one updater
//!   touches the binary at a time;
//! - a **version stamp** so a second updater skips a download already done;
//! - **MANDATORY SHA256** verification against the release's `<asset>.sha256` —
//!   the self-replacing binary runs `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, so an
//!   unverifiable download (missing/unfetchable checksum) ABORTS the update;
//! - a **pre-swap smoke test** (`<tmp> --version`) so a corrupt/wrong-arch binary
//!   never gets swapped in;
//! - a **backup** (`mafold.old`) for `mafold rollback`.
//!
//! Used by the supervisor (which owns updates for its daemons) and by a
//! standalone `mafold agent` (self-update, unless `--no-auto-update`).
//!
//! Two CHANNELS (`stable` / `dev`) — see [`Channel`]. The dev channel is how a
//! real machine runs a prerelease build without switching auto-update off for
//! everything on it.
